If you're using a JS framework such as [next.js](/docs/installation/nextjs), check out the 
[detailed instructions](/docs/installation/nextjs) for it. 
The instructions below should work for most setups though.

Installing `kea` is rather straightforward. You need to install some packages, reset kea's context and 
wrap your app with react-redux's `<Provider />` tag.

## Install the packages

In addition to `kea` you will also need [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/), 
[`react-redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [`reselect`](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect). 

```shell
# if you're using yarn
yarn add kea redux react-redux reselect

# if you're using npm
npm install kea redux react-redux reselect --save
```

## Set up Kea's context

Kea stores all of its data on a **context**, which must be set up before any `logic` can be used. This 
context stores a reference to the redux store, initializes all plugins, caches all built logic and keeps
track of what is mounted and what is not.

To set it up, just call `resetContext(options)` before rendering your app.

Then wrap your `<App />` with Redux's `<Provider />`, getting the `store` from `getContext()`.

This is how your `index.js` would look like if you used `create-react-app`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { resetContext, getContext } from 'kea' // ðŸ‘ˆ add this
import { Provider } from 'react-redux' // ðŸ‘ˆ add this
import './index.css'
import App from './App'

resetContext({ // ðŸ‘ˆ add this    
    createStore: {
        // options for redux (e.g. middleware, reducers, ...)
    },
    plugins: [
        // additional kea plugins
    ],
})

ReactDOM.render( // ðŸ‘ˆ and update this    
    <Provider store={getContext().store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
)
```

That's it! Feel free to use `kea()` calls anywhere in your code!
