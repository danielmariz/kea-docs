Here are some more things you can do with Kea. Learn these to fully master the framework!

## Lifecycles

Kea's `logic` has three different states: 

1. **Initialized**. When your JavaScript interpreter encounters a `const logic = kea(input)` call, not
   much happens. It just stores the `input` variable on the logic and goes on. No processing takes place.
2. **Built**. When a logic is needed, it must first be built. This means converting
   an `input` such as `{ actions: () => ({ ... }) }` into actual functions on `logic.actions`
   that can be called. Same for all the `reducers`, `selectors`, etc.
3. **Mounted**. Once a logic is built, it can be mounted. This means attaching the `reducers` to
   Redux, registering all the `listeners`, etc.  

If you use Kea [without React](/docs/guide/standalone) or alongside it, you have to mount and unmount
`logic` manually. 

If you use Kea [with React](/docs/guide/react), every time you access a `logic` via `useValues` or another 
method, it is built and mounted automatically. When the component that used this `logic` is removed from
React's tree and no other component is using it, the `logic` will be automatically unmounted.

This means that only `logic` which is actively in use will be mounted and attached to Redux.
This is practical knowledge when you have a large app with multiple scenes.
 
In addition, thanks to this, [code-splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) works out-of-the box
with Kea!

## Props

When you treat `logic()` as a function, you explicitly build it. 
If you pass it an object as an argument, that object will be saved as `props` on the built logic.

```javascript
const logic = kea({ ... })
const props = { id: 10 }

logic(props).props === props
```

Calling `logic()` is a fast operation: if the logic has already been built, it won't be rebuilt.
Only the props will be updated if needed.

You can pass random data from React onto the logic this way. For example various defaults. 

It's as simple as this: 

```jsx
function FancyPantsCounter() {
    const { counter } = useValues(counterLogic({ defaultCounter: 1000 }))

    // ...
}
```

Then just use `props` wherever you need to. For example:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        decrement: (amount) => ({ amount })
    }),

    reducers: ({ props }) => ({
        counter: [props.defaultCounter || 0, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }]
    }),

    listeners: ({ props }) => ({
        increment: ({ amount }) => {
            console.log(`incrementing by ${amount}`)
            console.log(`default ${props.defaultCounter || 0}`)
        }
    })
})
```

### Props in Selectors

Since `selectors` need to be recalculated when their inputs change, there's a twist when 
using `props` with them.

Take the following buggy code:
 
```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    // ...
    selectors: ({ selectors, props }) => ({
        diffFromDefault: [
            () => [selectors.counter],
            (counter) => counter - props.defaultCounter // DO NOT do this!
        ]
    })
})
``` 

The code will work, but only partially.
The problem is that the value of `diffFromDefault` will only be updated when `counter` changes,
but not when `props.defaultCounter` changes.

What if we would also like to update the selector when the props change? 
 
Previously we defined a selector as a function like this:

```javascript
const selector = (state) => state.path.to.something.counter
```

That's an incomplete definition. Selectors take a second argument called `props`.

```javascript
const selector = (state, props) => state.path.to.something.counter + props.defaultCounter
```

To make your new selector update itself when a prop changes, it's easiest to define an inline
selector that picks the right value from `props`. Here's an example:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    // ...
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        diffFromDefault: [
            () => [
                selectors.counter, 
                (_, props) => props.defaultCounter
            ],
            (counter, defaultCounter) => counter - defaultCounter
        ]
    })

})
```

## Keyed logic

If you give your logic a `key`, you can have multiple independent copies of it. The key is derived 
from `props`:

```javascript
const userLogic = kea({
    key: (props) => props.id, // ðŸ”‘ the key

    actions: () => ({
        loadUser: true,
        userLoaded: (user) => ({ user })
    }),
  
    reducers: () => ({
        user: [null, {
            userLoaded: (_, { user }) => user
        }]
    }),

    // more on events in a section below. 
    events: ({ actions }) => ({
        afterMount: [actions.loadUser]
    }),

    listeners: ({ props }) => ({
        loadUser: async () => {
            const user = await api.getUser({ id: props.id }),
            actions.userLoaded(user)
        }
    })
})
```

Now every time you call `userLogic({ id: 1 })` with a new `id`, a completely independent
logic will be built and mounted.

This is really handy when you have data that's passed as a props in React, such as:

```jsx
function User({ id }) {
    const { user } = useValues(userLogic({ id }))

    return user 
        ? <div>{user.name} ({user.email})</div> 
        : <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

No matter how many times `<User id={1} />` is rendered by React, it'll always be connected
to the same logic. In practical terms this means the user will be loaded only once.

If you render `<User id={2} />`, it'll however get its own independent copy of this same base logic
and do what is needed to load and display the second user. 


## Defaults

There are two ways to pass defaults to reducers. We've been using this style until now:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    // ... actions: () => ({ increment, decrement })

    reducers: () => ({
        counter: [0, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }]
    }),
})
```

If you choose, you can set your defaults explicitly in a `defaults` object:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    // ... actions: () => ({ increment, decrement })
  
    defaults: {
        counter: 0
    },

    reducers: () => ({
        counter: {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }
    })
})
```

In case you pass both, the value in the `defaults` object will take precedence.

You can also pass selectors as defaults:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({ ... })

const logic = kea({
    defaults: () => ({ // must be a function to evaluate lazily
        counterCopy: counterLogic.selectors.counter
    }),

    reducers: () => ({
        counterCopy: [counterLogic.selectors.counter, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }]
    })
})
```

You can take it one level deeper and return a selector that computes the defaults:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    defaults: () => (state, props) => ({
        // simple value
        simpleDefault: 0,
        // returning a selector
        directName: someLogic.selectors.storedName
        // returning a value through a selector
        connectedName: someLogic.selectors.storedObject(state, props).name,
    })
})
```

## Connecting logic together

Kea is said to be a *really scalable* state management library. This power comes from its ability
to link together actions and values from different `logic`s.

### The new way (v2.0+)

Wiring logic together is easier than you think. Suppose we have these two logics:

```javascript
// stores a list of users, referenced everywhere in the app
const usersLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        loadUsers: true,
        loadUsersSuccess: (users) => ({ users })
    }),
    reducers: () => ({
        users: [[], {
            loadUsersSuccess: (_, { users }) => users
        }]
    })
    // ... listeners, etc
})

// handles data shown on our dashboard scene
const dashboardLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        refreshDashboard: true    
    }),

    listeners: () => ({
        refreshDashboard: async () => {
            // pull data from the API, update values shown on the dashboard 
        }
    })
})
```

Our pointy-haired-boss now tasked us with reloading the dashboard every time the users are 
successfully loaded. How do we do that?

Just use the action on `usersLogic` as a key in the `listeners` object:

```javascript
const dashboardLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        refreshDashboard: true    
    }),

    listeners: () => ({
        refreshDashboard: async () => {
            // pull data from the API, update values shown on the dashboard 
        },
        [usersLogic.actions.loadUsersSuccess]: ({ users }) => {
            actions.refreshDashboard()
            // we also get `users` in the payload, 
            // but we socially distance ourselves from them
        } 
    })
})
```

This syntax also works in reducers:

```javascript
const usersLogic = kea({ ... })

const shadowUsersLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        reset: true
    }),
    reducers: ({ actions }) => ({
        users: [[], {
            reset: () => [], // action that's defined in this logic
            [actions.reset]: () => [], // another way to call a local action
            [usersLogic.actions.loadUsersSuccess]: (_, { users }) => users
        }]
    })
})
```

and selectors:

```javascript
const usersLogic = kea({ ... })

const sortedUsersLogic = kea({
    selectors: () => ({
        sortedUsers: [
            () => [usersLogic.selectors.users],
            (users) => [...users].sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))
        ]
    })
})
```

... and probably everywhere else you might expect.

What if we need the list of users when refreshing the dashboard? 

Just get the value directly from `usersLogic.values`:

```javascript
const dashboardLogic = kea({
    // ...
    listeners: () => ({
        refreshDashboard: async () => {
            if (!usersLogic.values.users) {
                usersLogic.actions.loadUsers()
            }
        }
    })
})
```

In all of these cases, `usersLogic` will be automatically connected to the logic that called it.
This means that it will be mounted either directly (when used inside listeners) or whenever your
logic is mounted. It will also be unmounted when your logic is unmounted.

### The old way (v1.0 and prior)

While the "new way" of connecting logic might seem self-evident, there's actually a lot that's
happening under the hood. 

Kea's logic is always "lazy", meaning it's not built nor mounted before it's needed. In the examples
above, if the first time `usersLogic` is referenced is when its actions are used as keys in another
logic's reducers, it will get built and mounted then and there.
 
This wasn't always the case. Before version 2.0 there was no guarantee that `otherLogic.actions`
would already be there. You had to either track this yourself or use `connect`.

It still works though. The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
const counterLogic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: (amount) => ({ amount }),
        decrement: (amount) => ({ amount })
    }),

    reducers: () => ({
        counter: [0, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }]
    }),
})

const logic = kea({
    connect: {
        // pulling in actions from `counterLogic`
        actions: [counterLogic, ['increment', 'decrement']],
        // pull in values from `counterLogic`
        values: [counterLogic, ['counter']]
    },

    // using the actions in a reducer like they're our own
    doubleCounter: [0, {
        increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount * 2,
        decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount * 2
    }],
    
    // pretend that we own the selector as well 
    selectors: ({ selectors }) => ({
        tripleCounter: [
            () => [selectors.counter],
            (counter) => counter * 3
        ]
    })
})
```

## Extending logic

Up until a logic has been built and mounted, you can extend it:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    actions: () => ({
        increment: (amount = 1) => ({ amount }),
        decrement: (amount = 1) => ({ amount })
    }),
    
    reducers: () => ({
        counter: [0, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state + amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state - amount
        }]
    }),
})

logic.extend({
    reducers: () => ({
        negativeCounter: [0, {
            increment: (state, { amount }) => state - amount,
            decrement: (state, { amount }) => state + amount
        }]
    }),
})

// later in React
const { counter, negativeCounter } = useValues(logic)
```

Extending logic is especially powerful when [writing plugins](/docs/plugins/writing-plugins). For example to dynamically
add actions, reducers or listeners to a logic.


## Events

When running `kea({})`, nothing happens directly. It's only when your logic is actually called
upon (for example via `useValues(logic)`) that it gets **mounted**. When your logic is no longer
needed (for example the React component is removed from the page), your logic is **unmounted**.

You can hook into these events with the `events` object:

```javascript
const logic = kea({
    events: ({ actions, values }) => ({
        beforeMount: () => {
            console.log('run before the logic is mounted')
        },
        afterMount: () => {
            console.log('run after the logic is mounted')
        },
        beforeUnmount: () => {
            console.log('run before the logic is unmounted')
        },
        afterUnmount: () => {
            console.log('run after the logic is unmounted')
        }
    })
})
```

The useful events are `afterMount` and `beforeUnmount`, as when they are called
you have access to all the `actions`, `values`, etc of the logic.

All events accept either a function or an array of functions. If your actions have no arguments,
you can put them in the array directly without making a new function:

```javascript
const usersLogic = kea({
    events: ({ actions, values }) => ({
        afterMount: [
            actions.fetchUsers,
            () => actions.fetchDetails(values.user.id)
        ],
        
        // these four lines do the same:
        beforeUnmount: actions.cleanup, 
        beforeUnmount: [actions.cleanup],
        beforeUnmount: () => actions.cleanup(),
        beforeUnmount: [() => actions.cleanup()],
    })
})
```
