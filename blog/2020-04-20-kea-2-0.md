Nothing breaks, but enough conceptual changes to warrant a new major version.

TODO: clean up the changelog below and update CHANGELOG.md

New stuff:

- No need to write `[actions.something]`, just write `something` in reducers and listeners
- No need for `connect`, just use `otherLogic.actions/selectors/values.something` 
  (e.g. in listeners, selectors, reducers) and everything is mounted automatically, 
  opt out by passing `autoConnect: false` to `resetContext` 
- Listeners in core (use `resetContext({ skipPlugins: ['listeners'] })`) to opt out
- Extending reducers merges the mapping instead of overriding with the last one
- No need to specify/whitelist path starts in createStore (was: ['kea', 'scenes'], now all allowed)
- Action creators no longer skip 'scenes.' in type string
- `resetContext({ createStore: true })` is now true by default
- Basic Typescript support (TODO!)
