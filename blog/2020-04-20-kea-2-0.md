Nothing breaks, but enough conceptual changes to warrant a new major version.

New stuff:

- No need to write `[actions.something]`, just write `something` in reducers and listeners
- No need for `connect`, just use `otherLogic.actions.something`
- Listeners in core
- Basic Typescript support (TODO!)
